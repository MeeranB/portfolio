                            I am a UK based developer with both academic and extracurricular experience with web development, having completed a CertHE at the University of Warwick in Computer Science, and most recently by securing a place on the intensive SCS Coalition Scheme run by Netmatters. These experiences have helped develop my deep interest in web development and the industry as a whole, and I am keen to become a valuable asset to your company.

                            Having studied at the University of Warwick, a top 10 leading academic institute for Computer Science, I was awarded a CertHE in 2019. During this course I formally studied, and was assessed on the fundamentals, this included:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Design of information structures</li>
                            <li>Database systems</li>

                            <li>Software Development Methodologies</li>
                            <li>Computer Organisation & Architecture</li>
                            <li>The Fundamentals of Web Development</li>

                        <p>
                            During this year I began familiarising myself with programming in Java and gained a familiarity with coding commonly used data structures and control flow processes, as well as studying the concepts behind Object Oriented Programming.

                        <p>
                            I also had the opportunity to write optimised SQL queries as part of the database systems module, and to begin coding in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as part of the Web development module.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I had a particular interest in the web development module which lead me to seek out the <a class="main-link" href="scs.html">Netmatters SCS Coalition program.</a>
